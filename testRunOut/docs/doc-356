this  adapter  class  provides  default  implementations  for  the  methods  described  the  code accessible control listener  code  interface  classes  that  wish  deal  with  code accessible control event  code  can  extend  this  class  and  override  only  the  methods  that  they  are  interested  note  accessibility  clients  use  child  identifiers  specify  whether  they  want  information  about  control  one  its  children  child  identifiers  are  increasing  integers  beginning  with  the  identifier  childid  self  represents  the  control  itself  when  returning  child  identifier  client  you  may  use  childid  none  indicate  that  child  control  has  the  required  information  note  this  adapter  typically  used  implementors  custom  control  provide  very  detailed  information  about  the  control  instance  accessibility  clients  see accessible control listener  see accessible control event  since
